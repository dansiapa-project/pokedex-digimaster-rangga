This app would have information related to 900+ pokemon, 800+ moves and items. Additional features include pagination and search filter.

## Project setup
This should be a piece of cake for you if you have worked under npm environment before. Simply initialize an empty project using 'npm init' and then install packages. You'd also need to configure .env file in Vue style since I am not uploading env file and Url to fetch pokemon data is contained in the env file. Vue documentation could prove to be very helpful if you are stuck here. Simply clone the project and install dependencies.
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
### Compiles and minifies for production
